This proactive work increases the resilience of the urban forest and leads to improved lifespans for trees and less damage from severe weather, such as extreme winds or late/early seasonal snowfalls. The City also completes regular tree assessments to ensure asset management data is accurate, enabling informed decision making and the efficient use of available funds. Risk-based assessments of 50,000 trees begin in the fall of 2024.  As of mid-June, over 11,750 trees have been pruned.",Progressing as planned,Primary,07/09/2024
Urban Forestry,Performance Measure 2,Number of trees planted annually,Climate,6835,1127,7500,"In 2024, the service plans to plant 8,000 trees, 6,000 of which were lifecycle replacements. To improve progress towards the Municipal Development Plan target (we’re currently at about 50 per cent of the target), Urban Forestry will plant another 2,000 trees (8,000 in total). To fund the budget shortfall in caliper trees, we applied to a federal grant program. Due to water restrictions, a 4-week hold was put on planting operations. At mid-year, 1127 trees were planted, and we forecast that our annual goal will be reached.",Not progressing as planned,Primary,07/16/2024

Overall, waste generated is down 3 per cent on a per household basis compared to the same time last year. Our ongoing communication and education efforts aim to help Calgarians reduce waste, increase recycling and composting, and reduce contamination in cart programs.

Waste & Recycling,Performance Measure 4,"Waste Collection Interruptions per 10,000 Scheduled Stops",Not Applicable,5,5,5,"Interruptions to waste collection are within normal ranges. Historically, there has been a higher proportion of uncollected carts in the pilot areas for residential black cart collection serviced by our contractor. This has normalized, and in Q2, the pilot areas represented 25 per cent of collection interruptions for black cart service. We saw a slight increase in missed collections overall with new collection days and routes introduced in early 2024. We expect this to stabilize as customers and drivers adjust to new collection days.

This measure reflects the time it takes the Water Utility to respond to a customer that is experiencing a wastewater backup. This metric currently stands at 5.08 hours.
