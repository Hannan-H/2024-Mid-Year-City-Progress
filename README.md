3. Real Estate Glut & Downtown Revitalization

A surplus of downtown office space has depressed property values and undermined municipal tax revenues. In response, Calgary has offered generous subsidies (C$75/sq ft) for converting office buildings into residential units. Early projects show promise but are hindered by escalating construction costs.

Repurposing older buildings also entails structural challenges, as seen in past retrofit efforts.

4. Infrastructure Delays & Major Project Uncertainty

Key infrastructure projects face postponement or uncertainty. For instance, the Green Line LRT project was halted in 2024 due to the provincial government withdrawing its funding, though construction has now resumed with groundbreaking in June 2025.
